## Features

*   **Customizable Themes:** Allow users to choose from different themes (light, dark, high contrast) to personalize their experience.

*   **Detailed User Profiles:** Provide detailed user profiles that allow users to manage their information, preferences, and security settings.

*   **Advanced Search Functionality:** Implement a powerful search engine that can index and search across all project content, including documents, comments, and code.
